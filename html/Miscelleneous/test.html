            <p class="heading2">Biography</p>
            <p>
                Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in
                Reading, Pennsylvania.
                Swift spent her early years on her family's Christmas
                tree farm in nearby Wyomissing.
                Her grandmother had been a professional opera singer,
                and Swift soon followed in her footsteps.
                By the age of 10, Swift was singing at a variety of
                local events, including fairs and contests.
                She sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a Philadelphia
                76ers basketball game at the age of 11, and
                began writing her own songs and learning guitar at 12
                years old.
            </p>

            <p>
                To pursue her music career, Swift often visited
                Nashville, Tennessee, the country music capital.
                There she co-wrote songs and tried to land a recording
                contract.
                Noting her dedication, Swift and her family moved to
                nearby Hendersonville, Tennessee, in an attempt
                to further Swift’s career.
            </p>

            <p>
                A stellar performance at The Bluebird Café in Nashville
                helped Swift get a contract with Scott
                Borchetta’s Big Machine Records.
                She released her first single, “Tim McGraw,” in 2006,
                and the song became a Top 10 hit on the
                country charts.
                It also appeared on her self-titled debut album in
                October of that same year, which went on to sell
                more than 5 million copies.
                More popular singles soon followed, including “Our
                Song,” a No. 1 country music hit.
                “Teardrops on My Guitar,” “Picture to Burn” and
                “Should’ve Said No” were also successful tracks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Swift also received critical praise for her debut
                effort.
                She won the Horizon Award from the Country Music
                Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music
                (ACM) Award for Top New Female Vocalist in 2007.
                Swift next released Sounds of the Season: The Taylor
                Swift Holiday Collection that year.
                Her renditions of “Silent Night” and “Santa Baby” were
                modest hits on the country charts.
            </p>


            <img height="300px" class="homepics enlarge-img" src="/images/Home/Taylor1.png">

            <p>
                In late June, Swift revealed her dismay that her catalog
                of music from her first six albums, up to
                reputation, had been sold by her first label to a
                company owned by Scooter Braun, manager of artists
                like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande and a person she
                accused of bullying tactics.
                “Scooter has stripped me of my life’s work, that I
                wasn’t given an opportunity to buy,” she wrote on
                Tumblr.
                “Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the
                hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.”
            </p>


            <p>
                Just before the August 23 release of Lover, Swift
                confirmed she would rerecord her old music to
                regain artistic and financial control of her catalog.
                Later that year, she claimed a whopping six wins at the
                American Music Awards, including artist of
                the year and artist of the decade honors.

        <p>
            Hi, I’m Taylor.
            I love the number 13.
            I was born in December on a Christmas tree farm.
            I like imagining what life was like hundreds of years ago.
            I have blurry eyesight. My favorite thing in life is writing
            about life, specifically the parts of life
            concerning love.
            Because, as far as I’m concerned, love is absolutely everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m easily excited, thrilled, scared, and shocked.
            I’m 24* now, but I never stopped jumping up and down when
            something wonderful happens.
            My biggest fear is getting bad news. Or, letting someone down.
            I really love showing people what I meant when I wrote a song,
            so my shows are very theatrical.
            I knock on wood constantly.
            I have a cat named Meredith. She’s named after my favorite
            character on Grey’s Anatomy, and she’s fantastic.
            I live in Nashville, a magical land where 99% of the people are
            friendly and courteous drivers who let you
            in and don’t honk at you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I go into a trance when I’m in an antique store.
            I don’t like it when something or someone turns out to be
            different than what you originally thought.
            Like when you’re shopping and you find a really cute dress, only
            to realize it’s actually a strange jumpsuit
            situation.
            But I mostly don’t like it when it happens with people. I love
            my friends and I’m always making new ones.
            I don’t really think you can ever stop making new friends or
            learning about as many new things as possible.
            I also don’t think you should ever take life so seriously that
            you forget to play.
        </p>

        <p>
            Music has taken me all over the world, but the fans are the
            reason it’s been so magical.
            I’m so blown away by how nice they are to me.
            It’s strange to feel so understood by such a large group of
            people, but I love it.
            For the last two years, I’ve been working on an album called
            Red.
            I called it that because of the tumultuous, crazy adventures in
            love and loss that it chronicles.
            In my mind, when you experience love that’s fast paced and out
            of control and mixes infatuation, jealousy,
            frustration, miscommunication, and all of those lovely emotions…
            In retrospect, it all looks red.
        </p>

        <p>
            I can’t wait for so many things.
            But mostly I can’t wait to see you, whether it’s in a crowd or a
            coffee shop.
            Thank you for listening, showing up, reading, and taking such
            good care of me.
        </p>

        <p class="heading2">Quotes of Taylor Swift</p>

        <p>“Karma is Real”</p>

        <p>
            “I love it when people say things to me in public and want to
            meet me, because I want to meet them! Early
            on, my manager told me, “If you want to sell 500,000 records,
            then go out there and meet 500,000 people.””
        </p>

        <p>
            “To me, Fearless is not the absense of fear. It’s not being
            completely unafraid. To me, Fearless is having
            fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, Fearless
            is living in spite of those things that
            scare you to death.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “What I’ve learned is not to change who you are, because
            eventually you’re going to run out of new things to
            become.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “You only get so many firsts, Every one is a blessing.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “The only place where it’s cool to be the same as everyone else
            is in junior high.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “People haven’t always been there for me but music always has.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “I wish all teenagers can filter through songs instead of
            turning to drugs and alcohol.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good
            to people is a wonderful legacy to leave
            behind.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can
            also put them back together. I hope you use
            yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than
            the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to
            intentionally hurt someone.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Never believe anyone who tells you that you don’t deserve what
            you want.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “Unique and different is the new generation of beautiful… You
            dont have to be like everybody else. In fact I
            don’t think you should.”
        </p>

        <p>
            “The world doesn’t owe you anything. You have to work for
            everything you get and you have to appreciate
            every bit of success the world gives you”
        </p>

        <p>
            "I'm intimidated by the fear of being average."
